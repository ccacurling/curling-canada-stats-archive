# About the Curling Canada Stats Archive

This is the official site for player career statistics across Curling Canada events. The initial focus is on Brier and Hearts events, but will hopefully be expanded over time.

Note: There are no detailed statistics available for the 1982 Brier.

If anyone has detailed statistics information from this Brier era, Curling Canada would like to incorporate that into this site. Contact <a href="mailto:bcassidy@curling.ca">bcassidy@curling.ca</a>.
